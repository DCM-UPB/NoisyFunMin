# RESULTS OF EXAMPLE 3 FitNN

In this folder some results from fitting NNs to a gaussian are saved.
The filename X_Y.txt tells the number of hidden units: X for first layer, 
Y for second hidden layer. The data is plotted via plot.py and compared to 
the target gaussian. The result can be seen in plot.pdf.
In this case the best fit was achieved with 14 hidden units in one hidden layer.
